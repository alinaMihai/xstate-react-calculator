# Xstate React Calculator

Based on https://github.com/GiancarlosIO/xstate-react-calculator, but with some new functionalities and bug fixes. 

Article about this effort on [dev.to](https://dev.to/alinamihai/extending-the-functionality-of-react-calculator-xstate-example-67h)

Extra Features:

- add +/- button and handle operations with negative numbers (I used the Mac calculator as a reference for the behaviour)
- implement operations history: keep a string of all operations until user hits equals

Bug fixes:

- prevent entering multiple leading zeros
- correctly add two percentages together: e.g. 100% + 100%, should display 2
- correctly set the operator after each step of an operation: e.g. 1 - 1 + 2 / 2, should display 1
- handle decimal point for result state

Other improvements:

- add unit tests for operations history and for some bug fixes
- adjust calculator style for better eye comfort
- fix linting errors
